            The Enforcers were once led by Alec Masters... and it shows. All the experience, skills, and firepower you would expect from the military/police... and just as much of the facism. As long as your a good little dog who can take orders or a sociopathic dictator, these folks will love you.

            The Light Bearers are all noble and shit... they like to heal people and support upstart communities.

            The Travelers are made up of a loose collection of families with a hand in every criminal enterprise in the wastes. They aren't all bad though, they have a code... that only really applies to other Travelers. With friends like these guys who needs enemies?

            The Techs are the smartest people in the wasteland, which makes sense since their ideological forefathers probably created it. Some Techs seek the advancement of technology at all costs and others are just trying to use it to make the wastes a slightly better place. The techs are pretty nice guys all around... as long as you aren't a test subject... or the environment.

    <h2>Understanding how characters differ in the apocalypse</h2>
    <article>
      <p>Unlike many other MMOs where you strive to improve your (often based on class) primary attributes as much as possible and then your skills, Fallen Earth characters are built within a classless system. This means the approach one takes to building a character is almost reverse that of other more standard modern MMO experiences. A build in Fallen Earth starts with you identifying which abilities/mutations you want to end up with and then working towards those. Fallen Earth builds are focused around a selection of abilities with the intention being to have one of each available type of buff in your build (at least).</p>
      <h3>Types of buffs available:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Aura</li>
        <li>Stance</li>
        <li>Toggle</li>
        <li>Science/Nature/Mutagenics/Medicine</li>
        <li>Food</li>
        <li>Drink</li>
        <li>Tent (construction)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Aura, stance, and toggle buffs are particularly important to be mindful of because in addition to being buffs you cannot purchase from another player, they often effect skills and can be used to save AP in your build.</p>
